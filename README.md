# topMost
## TopMost is a free, open source application that allows you to keep windows always on top of other windows.
The idea is that you sometimes need a window to always be visible, with topMost you can keep any number of windows always on top of other windows.
This is useful when you have for example a document maximized on the screen and you want to copy data from it to another smaller size window (e.g. calculator). Instead of going back and forth between the windows, or trying to rearrange both, with TopMost you can keep the calculator on top of the document.

This C# project was created long time ago and is hosted at sourceforge.
